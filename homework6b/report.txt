The purpose of git is to have revision control of files during collaborative efforts.
git init initiaties a git repository under the directory named.
git add adds the fill(s) specified.  You can use git add .  to add files in that directory or git add -A to add all files and folders in subdirectories.
git commit commits the changes to git and the -m flag adds a message to describe the changes.  A message is required for all commits.
