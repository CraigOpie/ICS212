Requirements not met/not functional: None
Additional features/extra credit: I implemented all extra credit items, however, I did not test the assignment operator as it was not required for this assignment.
Futer enhancements and/or general comments: I made the necessary corrections from project 1.  I was having issues because I was not setting next to NULL durring addRecord.  Also, I flushed the buffer when the user types too many characters for name and address by looping until the '\n'.  I used the same testing conditions as project 1, but I added reversing the list forward and backwards.  Although filename is not included in the constructor in this project, I ensured the user was not able to overflow the filename array by limiting the input and notifying the user if the filename was too long.
