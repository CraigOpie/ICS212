addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

define a pointer to record called temp
define a pointer to record called last
define an int called wrote
copy from start to last
copy from -1 to wrote

while( next in the record whose address is in last is not equal to NULL )
    copy from next in the record whose address is in last to last

if( start is equal to last )
    copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in last
    copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in last
    copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in last
    copy from 0 to wrote
else
    allocate a heap space and store its address into temp
    copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in temp
    copy from temp to next in the record whose address is in last
    copy from 0 to wrote

return wrote
